# Lab7

In this lab I created a makefile that compiles all the pieces of a program. This particular program simply prints out a string of text. Anytime the string message is changed you will run the makefile and it will update.
If you try to run the makefile and there are no changes, the makefile will simply say "nothing to update"

'make clean'
Make clean will clear everything. Calling make again will compile the makefile again as if it were never compiled. 

'make' 
compiles the program if any changes were made to printThis.h or main.cpp or printThis.cpp
